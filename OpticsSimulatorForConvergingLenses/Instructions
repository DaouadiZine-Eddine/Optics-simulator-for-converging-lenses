--- Optics Simulator by DAOUADI Zine-Eddine Chahine. --

The current program is the finalized version of an optics simulator that I have developped 2 years ago.
I hope that it not only fulfills the need for modelisation that was at the center of the project, but also allows you to discover how light behaves through a lens in certain
circumstances.

--- Instructions for the user. ---

#1 - Download the latest release : https://github.com/DaouadiZine-Eddine/Optics-simulator-for-converging-lenses.git
#2 - Extract the folder.
#3 - Run the "simulator.exe" file and choose your language. 

The data of the simulator, as well as its assets (which I made with Pixlr for the images) is available to see as well as the html pages for the english and french version.
Moreover, the launcher closes once the language is chosen and you are brought to the main pages.

-- Contents of the project -- 

-Original assets made for optics using pixlr.
-French and English versions of the simulator.
-Accurate modelization of light rays and their path through a converging lens.
-Source code for the simulator.

--- Objectives & intention behind the code. ---

As the publisher, the project was made with the belief that the user would have enough basic knowledge on optics to perceive the sense behind it and the notations.
I believe that my work may be imperfect, and it will be for years to come but it is through progress and sheer will that through efforts I desire to improve.
I am open to any commentary on this project, and any possible enhancement that may come from it or even any criticism related to it so that I may be able to have
hindsight as to my strenghts and weaknesses.

It would really be appreciated for the author of the code to be credited if any sample from the source code is taken. 

Cordially,
DAOUADI Zine-Eddine Chahine.
