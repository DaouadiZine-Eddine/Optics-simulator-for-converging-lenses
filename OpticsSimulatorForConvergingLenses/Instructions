--- Optics Simulator by DAOUADI Zine-Eddine Chahine. --

The current program is the finalized version of an optics simulator, that I have been working on for several years.
I hope that it not only fulfills the need for modelisation that was at the center of the project, but also allows you to discover how light behaves through a lens in certain
circumstances.

--- Objectives & intention behind the code. ---
As I am publishing this, I am a student in a preparatory class and this project was made with the belief that the user would have enough basic knowledge on optics to perceive
the sense behind it and the notations.
I believe that my work may be imperfect, and it will be for years to come but it is through progress and sheer will that through efforts I desire to improve.
I am open to any commentary on this project, and any possible enhancement that may come from it or even any criticism related to it so that I may be able to have
hindsight as to my strenghts and weaknesses.

It would really be appreciated for the author of the code to be credited if any sample from the source code is taken. 

I believe that science is a construct, that we all must participate in.
Reality is often confusing, hard to perceive but if we give sens to it and gather the shapes together we can make something cohesive.
Such was the intent of this project, enlightening on a difficult topic where simulations can be either too confusing or too complicated.
I tried my best to stay simple, and I hope to have succeeded in doing so but that is left to your judgement.

Cordially,
DAOUADI Zine-Eddine Chahine.
